    ## PrognosisHub-Disease Prediction System
    
    Welcome to the PrognosisHub a Multiple Disease Prediction System, created by Kanchan Rai. 
    This application allows you to predict the likelihood of having different diseases: Diabetes, Heart Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Breast Cancer.
    The prediction is based on 4 different machine learning models.
    Use the sidebar to navigate to specific prediction pages.

    ### Breast Cancer Prediction
    This model utilizes scikit-learn to implement a logistic regression model for breast cancer prediction.
    After loading the breast cancer dataset and organizing it into features and target variables, the data is split into training and testing sets.
    A logistic regression model is then trained using the training data.
    The accuracy of the model is evaluated on both the training and testing sets, providing insights into its performance.
    Subsequently, the trained model is used to make predictions on new data, showcasing its application for predicting whether a tumor is malignant or benign.
    Additionally, the code includes a mechanism to save the trained model using the pickle library, facilitating reuse without the need for retraining.

    ### Diabetes Prediction
    This Model utilizes the scikit-learn library to develop a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for predicting diabetes based on the PIMA Diabetes dataset.
    It involves data preprocessing, including standard scaling, and the dataset is split into training and testing sets. A linear kernel SVM model is trained and evaluated for accuracy.
    The script also showcases making predictions on new data and uses the pickle library to save the trained model for future use, enhancing efficiency and reusability in diabetes prediction tasks.

    ### Heart Disease Prediction
    This model employs the scikit-learn library to construct a logistic regression model for predicting heart disease based on a provided dataset.
    The dataset is loaded and examined to understand its structure and content. Essential data preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values and splitting into training and testing sets, are executed.
    Subsequently, the logistic regression model is trained utilizing the training data, and its accuracy is assessed on both the training and test datasets.
    Furthermore, a predictive system is implemented to make predictions on new input data.
    The model concludes by saving the trained model using the pickle library for future deployment in heart disease prediction tasks.

    ### Parkinson's Disease Prediction
    This model utilizes the scikit-learn library to implement a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for predicting Parkinson's disease based on a provided dataset.
    The dataset is loaded and analyzed, including an examination of the first and last 10 rows, checking for missing values, and exploring basic statistics.
    The dataset is then split into training and testing sets, and the features are standardized using StandardScaler. A linear SVM model is trained on the standardized training data, and its accuracy is evaluated on both the training and test datasets.
    Finally, a predictive system is established to make predictions on new input data, and the trained SVM model is saved using the pickle library for future use in Parkinson's disease prediction tasks.
